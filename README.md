Jam dashboard is a simply highly-configurable tooling for guitar players.

It includes:
- Fretboard note visualizer supporting arbitrary tunings and number of strings
- Ear training tests including individual notes and different chord types
- Chord explorer which includes a quick way to hear different chords, and to visualize voicings on the fretboard
