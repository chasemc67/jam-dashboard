# Jam Dashboard

Jam dashboard is a simply highly-configurable tooling for finding/visualizing specific notes on a guitar fretboard with arbitrary tunings.  
Most other tools either don't support custom tunings, or will only show entire scales/arpegios/etc.  
With Jam Dashboard you can highlight just the notes you need, in any tuning, and with specific colors per-note
